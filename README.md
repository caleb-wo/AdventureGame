# Java Adventure Game
This is a command-line java game that I made a part of a special topics class at BYUâ€“Idaho. After learning object oriented programming, this was the project that was used to solidfy learning. It's a vanilla Java project whose build tool is Maven. It's a perfect example to take a look at my understanding of object oriented programming.
